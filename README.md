# Messenger

## About

Simple messenger app with roles, built during first three days of ruby exposure outside of RSpec. Built on Postgres, also only studied theoretically prior. Frontend uses Bootstrap v4, with which I have some experience from v2. Nothing fancy. I may, however, have fallen in love with Ruby.

## Todo

* Nicer UI.

* Implement user search.

* Prevent unsolicited messages. 

* Configure Clearance to send emails.

* Further implement roles, which are now limited to models.

* Improve algorithm for getting recent chats. Currently enumerates all messages before calculating most recent conversations.
